                <section class='inner-text'>
                    <p>I am a full-time student in Thinkful’s boot camp 
                        learning front end web design.</p>
                    
                    <p>I worked for a print and bindery company and 
                        I held a few positions in the plant, ending up in IT/Mailing. 
                        I started designing Access Databases and fell in love with VBA.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before I was assigned to the IT/Mailing office I worked as the shipping clerk. 
                        It was there as I dissected the shipping database that I began to learn VBA code. 
                        I fell in love with the power and ability of the code.</p>
                    
                    <p>Being a very logical minded person makes web development very satisfying to me. 
                        I like a challenge and solving problems. 
                        More than that I like helping people and learning new ways to do that.</p>
                    
                    <p>Out of the office you can find me drawing portraits, cooking, 
                        or trying to help those around me.</p>
